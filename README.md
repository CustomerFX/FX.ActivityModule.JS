# FX.ActivityModule.JS
A javascript library module that provides simple, configurable customization to the activity and history dialogs & tabs in Infor CRM Web. The library allows for customizations to be easily configured (in the CustomConfigurations.js file) or via declarative use by registering customizations at runtime.

## Configuring Customizations

Customizations can be configured in the CustomConfigurations.js file. This file simply returns an array of configuration objects. You can add configuration objects to this array and they will be automatically loaded at runtime. The configuration options available depend on the type of customization you are configuring.
